In this Blog Post I show several interesting, interactive data graphics created using the NOAA climate data.

# §1. Create a Database

First of all, we start by creating a database with three tables: temperatures, stations, and countries.


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

Before we read in any data, we will write a function to prepare our temperatures dataframe by making it more organized and readable. It is better to do this step before incorporating this data into our database.


```python
def prepare_df(df):
    """
    This function takes in temperatures dataframe and reshapes it into an
    easier to read dataframe.
    """
    df = df.set_index(keys=["ID", "Year"]) #change index of df
    df = df.stack() #stack all of the data values on top of each other
    df = df.reset_index() #change index back to default index
    #change column names to be more readable
    df = df.rename(columns = {"level_2"  : "Month" , 0 : "Temp"})
    #change months into numerical values (1-12)
    df["Month"] = df["Month"].str[5:].astype(int)
    df["Temp"]  = df["Temp"] / 100 #change tempreture to celsius
    return(df)
```

In order to create a database, we need to import the `sqlite3` module. Now we will create an empty database  called `temps.db`, and we will connect to this database.


```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db") # create a database in current directory called temps.db
```

We are now ready to read in our datasets. Let's start by reading in the temperature data. This is a large dataset, so it is a good idea to read it in by chuncks and we will do that by using the `pd.read_csv()` function and specifying the `chunksize` to read in each iteration.
Then we use the `df.to_sql()` method which writes to a specified table in the database. We also need to specify if_exists to ensure that we add each piece to the table, rather than overwriting them each time.


```python
df_iter = pd.read_csv("temps.csv", chunksize = 100000) # read the tempreture data
for df in df_iter:
    df = prepare_df(df) #prepare the data
    df.to_sql("temperatures", conn, if_exists = "append", index = False) #append to table
```

Similarly, we can do the same thing for the stations and countries datasets. Note that these datasets are much smaller, so we don't need to worry about reading them in by chunks. And of course we add them to our existing database, which now includes temperatures table. We will also close our database connection once we're done constructing it.


```python
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/noaa-ghcn/station-metadata.csv"
stations = pd.read_csv(url) #read stations data
stations.to_sql("stations", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)

countries_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysociety/gaze/master/data/fips-10-4-to-iso-country-codes.csv"
countries = pd.read_csv(countries_url) #read countries data
countries.to_sql("countries", conn, if_exists = "replace", index = False)
conn.close() #close connection
```
    

# §2. Write a Query Function

In this part, we will create a function called `query_climate_database()` which takes in the name of a country, year_begin, year_end, and month as arguments and returns a Pandas dataframe of temperature readings for the specified country, in the specified date range, in the specified month of the year.


```python
def query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month):
    
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db") #connect to temps database
    cmd = \
    f"""
    SELECT S.name, S.latitude, S.longitude, C.name, T.year, T.month, T.temp
    FROM temperatures T 
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON SUBSTR(T.id, 1, 2) = C.`FIPS 10-4` 
    WHERE T.year >= {year_begin} AND T.year <= {year_end} AND T.month == {month} AND C.name == "{country}"
    GROUP BY S.name, T.year, T.month, T.temp
    """
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn) #create df
    conn.close() #close connection
    
    return df
```

This dataframe should have columns for the station name, the latitude of the station, the longitude of the station, the name of the country in which the station is located, the year in which the reading was taken, the month in which the reading was taken, and the average temperature at the specified station during the specified year and month.

Let's do a test run and see if we get this information


```python
query_climate_database(country = "India", 
                       year_begin = 1980, 
                       year_end = 2020,
                       month = 1)
```
{% include df.html %}


# §3. Write a Geographic Scatter Function for Yearly Temperature Increases

We are intereseted in knowing how the average yearly change in temperature varies within a given country. To answer this question, we will create an interactive geographic scatterplot.

To do that, we will use the Plotly library.


```python
from plotly import express as px
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

Now we want to get an estimate of the yearly change in temperature during the specified month and time period at each station. To measure this we will compute the first coefficient of a linear regression model at that station.

Here's a function that computes this coefficient given a dataframe


```python
def coef(data_group):
    x = data_group[["Year"]]
    y = data_group["Temp"]
    LR = LinearRegression() #perform linear regression modeling
    LR.fit(x, y) #fit x = Year and y = Temp into this linear regression model
    return round(LR.coef_[0],4)
```

Now we will create a function called `temperature_coefficient_plot()` which accepts five explicit arguments, and an undetermined number of keyword arguments and outputs an interactive geographic scatterplot with a point for each station, such that the color of the point reflects an estimate of the yearly change in temperature during the specified month and time period at that station.


```python
def temperature_coefficient_plot(country, year_begin, year_end, month, min_obs, **kwargs):
    """
    Discription
    -----------
    This function creates an interactive geographic scatterplot with a point for each station,
    such that the color of the point reflects an estimate of the yearly change in temperature
    during the specified month and time period at that station.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    - country, a string giving the name of a country for which data should be returned.
    - year_begin and year_end, two integers giving the earliest and latest years for which should be returned.
    - month, an integer giving the month of the year for which data should be returned.
    - min_obs, the minimum required number of years of data for any given station.
    
    Return
    ------
    An interactive geographic scatterplot.
    """
    
    #get desired df from query function defined earlier
    df = query_climate_database(country, year_begin, year_end, month)
    #find the number of years of data for all stations
    gb = df.groupby(["NAME"])[["Temp"]].aggregate(len)
    #find stations that do not satisfy the minimum required number of years of data
    names = np.array(gb[gb['Temp'] < min_obs].reset_index()['NAME'])
    df = df.set_index('NAME').drop(names) #filter out stations that don't satisfy this requirement
    
    #find the first coefficient of a linear regression model at each station and rename
    coefs = df.groupby("NAME").apply(coef).reset_index().rename(columns={0: "Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)"})
    df = pd.merge(df, coefs, on = ["NAME"]) #add coefficient column to the dataframe
    
    #create a dictionary for month names to use in the plot title
    monthDict = {1:'January', 2:'February', 3:'March', 4:'April', 5:'May', 6:'June', 7:'July',
                 8:'August', 9:'September', 10:'October', 11:'November', 12:'December'}
    
    #create and interactive geographic scatterplot
    fig = px.scatter_mapbox(df, 
                            lat = "LATITUDE",
                            lon = "LONGITUDE", 
                            hover_name = "NAME",
                            color = "Estimated Yearly Increase (°C)",
                            height = 400,
                            title = "Estimates of Yearly Increase in Tempreture in %s for Stations in %s, Year %d-%d"%(monthDict[month], country, year_begin, year_end),
                            **kwargs)

    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":50,"l":0,"b":0})
    return fig
```

Let's now create a geographic visualization of the estimated yearly change in temperature in January for stations in India.


```python
color_map = px.colors.diverging.RdGy_r #choose a colormap

fig = temperature_coefficient_plot("India", 1980, 2020, 1, 
                                   min_obs = 10,
                                   zoom = 2,
                                   mapbox_style="carto-positron",
                                   color_continuous_scale=color_map)

fig.show()

```
{% include india.html %}


# §4. Create Two More Interesting Figures

Interesting right? Well I have some good news, we will create two more interesting figures!

The first one will be a choropleth map showing the maximum tempreture recorded in each country in a given year. To do that, we need to define a different query function for extracting data for this visualization. This function takes in an input for a year and finds the maximum tempreture recorded, in all station, for each country.


```python
def query_climate_database2(year):
    
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
    cmd = \
    f"""
    SELECT S.name, S.latitude, S.longitude, C.name, T.year, T.month, max(T.temp)
    FROM temperatures T 
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON SUBSTR(T.id, 1, 2) = C.`FIPS 10-4` 
    WHERE T.year == {year}
    GROUP BY C.name, T.year
    """
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    conn.close()
    
    return df
```

The code below uses the json module to read a GeoJSON file from the web. This file contains the borders of countries.


```python
from urllib.request import urlopen
import json

countries_gj_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/countries.geojson"

with urlopen(countries_gj_url) as response:
    countries_gj = json.load(response)
```

Now we will create a function called `max_temperature_plot()` which accepts one explicit argument, and an undetermined number of keyword arguments and outputs an interactive choropleth map showing the maximum tempreture recorded in each country in a given year.


```python
def max_temperature_plot(year, **kwargs):
    """
    Discription
    -----------
    This function creates an interactive choropleth map showing the maximum tempreture
    recorded in each country in a given year.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    - year, an integer giving the year for which w want to compare maximum tempretures.
    
    Return
    ------
    An interactive choropleth map.
    """
    
    #get desired df from query function defined earlier and rename the maximum tempreture column
    df = query_climate_database2(year).rename(columns={"max(T.temp)": "Maximum Tempreture (°C)"})
    
    #create and interactive choropleth map
    fig = px.choropleth(df, 
                        geojson=countries_gj,
                        locations = "Name",
                        locationmode = "country names",
                        color = "Maximum Tempreture (°C)", 
                        title = "Maximum Tempreture Recorded in Year %s"%year,
                        hover_name = "NAME",
                        height = 400,
                        **kwargs)

    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":0,"t":50,"l":0,"b":0})
    return fig
```

Let's see what were the maximum temperatures recorded in 2020


```python
fig = max_temperature_plot(2020,
                           color_continuous_scale=px.colors.sequential.Plasma)
fig.show()
```
{% include maxtemp.html %}


Our second figure will be a line plot comparing the average temperatures among all stations over time in two given countries for two given months.

We will also need to create another query function for extracting data for this visualization. This function takes in the names of two countries, and two different months as arguments and returns a Pandas dataframe of the average temperature recorded in each country in each month.


```python
def query_climate_database3(country1, country2, month1, month2):
    
    conn = sqlite3.connect("temps.db")
    cmd = \
    f"""
    SELECT S.name, C.name, T.year, T.month, avg(T.temp)
    FROM temperatures T 
    LEFT JOIN stations S ON T.id = S.id
    LEFT JOIN countries C ON SUBSTR(T.id, 1, 2) = C.`FIPS 10-4` 
    WHERE (C.name == "{country1}" OR C.name == "{country2}") AND (T.month == {month1} OR T.month == {month2})
    GROUP BY C.name, T.year, T.month
    """
    df = pd.read_sql_query(cmd, conn)
    conn.close()
    
    return df
```

Now we will create a function called `avg_temperature_plot()` which accepts four explicit argument, and an undetermined number of keyword arguments and outputs a line plot with multiple facets comparing the average temperatures at the two countries over time.


```python
def avg_temperature_plot(country1, country2, month1, month2, **kwargs):
    """
    Discription
    -----------
    This function creates a line plot with multiple facets comparing the average
    temperatures at the two countries over time.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    - country1 and country2, two strings giving the names of the two countries for which data should be returned.
    - month1 and month2, two integers giving the months of the year for which data should be returned.
    
    Return
    ------
    A line plot with multiple facets.
    """
    
    #get desired df from query function defined earlier
    df = query_climate_database3(country1, country2, month1, month2).rename(columns={"avg(T.temp)": "Avg Tempreture (°C)"})
    
    #create a column of type datetime usng month and year
    df["Date"] = df["Year"].astype(str) + "-" + df["Month"].astype(str)
    df["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Date"])
    
    #create a dictionary for month names
    monthDict = {1:'January', 2:'February', 3:'March', 4:'April', 5:'May', 6:'June', 7:'July', 8:'August', 9:'September', 10:'October', 11:'November', 12:'December'}
    df["Month"] = df['Month'].apply(lambda x: monthDict[x])
    
    fig = px.line(df,
                  x = "Date",
                  y = "Avg Tempreture (°C)",
                  color = "Month",
                  width = 800,
                  height = 400,
                  facet_col = "Name",
                  facet_row = "Month",
                  title = "Average %s and %s Temperatures Over Time in %s and %s"%(monthDict[month1], monthDict[month2], country1, country2),
                  **kwargs)

    fig.update_layout(margin={"r":50,"t":50,"l":0,"b":0})
    return fig
```

Let's compare the average temperatures in January and July in two different countries


```python
fig = avg_temperature_plot('Brazil', 'Russia', 1, 7)
fig.show()
```
