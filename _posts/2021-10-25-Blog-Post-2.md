In this blog post I implement a webscraper that recommends movies and TV shows based on my favorite TV show. The way it works is by finding movies and TV shows that share actors with my favorite TV show. I will be using "The Office" as my favorite TV show, and my repository for this project can be fund here: [https://github.com/jenelle99/IMDB_Scarper.git](https://github.com/jenelle99/IMDB_Scarper.git).

# The Webscraper

First, we create a file inside the spiders directory and add the following lines to the file:


```python
import scrapy

class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    
    name = 'imdb_spider' # name of file in our directory
    #link to The Office IMDB page
    start_urls = ['https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676/']
```

## `parse` Method Impementation

`parse(self, response)` is a function that navigates to the Cast & Crew page, assuming that we start on a movie page. We will use the fact that this page has url `<movie_url>fullcredits`. This function also calls the `parse_full_credits(self,response)`. The `parse()` method does not return any data.


```python
def parse(self, response): 
    """
    This function assumes that we start on a movie page then navigates to the
    Cast & Crew page, then calls the parse_full_credits() method.
    """
    # create full URL for crew page then call the function parse_full_credits
    yield scrapy.Request(response.urljoin("fullcredits"),
                         callback = self.parse_full_credits)
```

## `parse_full_credits` Method Implementation

`parse_full_credits(self, response)` assumes that we start on the Cast & Crew page. Its purpose is to yield a `scrapy.Request` for the page of each actor listed on the page. It does not include Crew members. It then calls the method `parse_actor_page(self, response)` when the actor’s page is reached. This method does not return any data.


```python
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
    """
    This function assumes that we start on the Cast & Crew page. It yields a
    scrapy.Request for the page of each actor listed on the page. The yielded
    request then calls the method parse_actor_page() when the actor’s page is
    reached. 
    """
    # use list comprehension to create a list of relative paths for each actor
    actor_links = [a.attrib['href'] for a in response.css('td.primary_photo a')]

    for link in actor_links:
        # create full URL for each actor then call the function parse_actor_page
        yield scrapy.Request(response.urljoin(link), callback = self.parse_actor_page)
```

## `parse_actor_page` Method Implementation

The `parse_actor_page(self, response)` method assumes that we start on the page of an actor. It then yields one dictionary of the form `{"actor" : actor_name, "movie_or_TV_name" : movie_or_TV_name}` for each of the movies or TV shows on which that actor has worked.


```python
def parse_actor_page(self, response):
    """
    This function assumes that we start on the page of an actor. It yields a
    dictionary with two key-value pairs of movies and actor names.
    """
    # get the name of the actor
    actor_name = response.css("div span.itemprop::text").get()
    
    # get all movie and TV show names for each actor 
    for movie in response.css("b a::text").getall():
        # for each movie yield a dictionary with actor and the corresponding movie
        yield {'actor' : actor_name, 'movie_or_TV_name' : movie}
```

Once the spider is fully written, we can run the following command to create a .csv file with a column for actors and a column for movies or TV shows.

`scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o results.csv`

# Making Recommendations

First, let's read in the resulting csv file.


```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("results.csv") # create csv file with the results
df
```

{% include resultss.html %}


Now in order to get the desired form of our recommendations dataframe, we will do some editing to the data frame then use `value_counts()` to find the number of times each movie or TV show appears in our dataframe.


```python
df = df.drop(['actor'], axis=1) # drop actor column from the dataframe
# make recommendations based on the number of times each movie or TV show appears in our dataframe
recommendations = df.value_counts().rename_axis('movie').reset_index(name='number of shared actors')
recommendations.head(10)
```

{% include recommendations.html %}
