*This blog post is a tutorial explaining how to construct an interesting data visualization of the Palmer Penguins data set.*

### Read the Data
First of all, let's start by reading our favorite dataset into Python using Pandas.

'''python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
'''

### Clean the Data
Now we don't need the entire penguins dataset to make one visualization, we will pick out only the relevant columns for our plot. I am interested to see the correlation between flipper length and body mass of the penguin, and whether or not the island on which the penguin lives has anything to do with its flipper length and body mass.

Some rows in the penguins dataframe contain NaN values which are missing information. In order to deal with that we need to drop the rows where at least one element is missing using df.dropna()

'''python
penguins = penguins[['Island', 'Flipper Length (mm)', 'Body Mass (g)']] #choose relevant columns
penguins = penguins.dropna() # remove missing values from the dataframe
'''
### Data Visualization 
Now it's time to actually create our plot!!!
To do that, we will use Seaborn which is is a data visualization library which works really well with Pandas. From Seaborn we will use the function relplot() to make a scatter plot. The relplot() function has arguments x, y and data parameters to specify values to be plotted on the x-axis, the y-axis and the data it should use. But we also want to encode the Island as point color, and for that we use hue.

'''python
import seaborn as sns
sns.relplot(x = 'Body Mass (g)',
            y = 'Flipper Length (mm)',
            data = penguins,
            hue = 'Island').set(title = 'Flipper Length vs. Body Mass') # Always set a title of your plot!
'''

From the plot, we can see that Penguins with larger body mass tend to have longer flipper length. We can also observe that penguins who live on Biscoe Island tend to have larger body mass than penguins who live on Torgersen and Dream islands.
